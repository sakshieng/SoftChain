### ðŸ”§ Setting up development environment

#### Step 1: Installation and Setup

- **VSCode**: Download VSCode from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
  
- **Node.js**: Download the latest version of Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/). After installation, check the version using the terminal: `node -v`.
  
- **Git**: Download the latest version of Git from the official website [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Check the version using the terminal: `git --version`.

#### Step 2: Create, Compile & Deploy Smart Contract

1. Open VSCode and open the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + '`.
2. Move to Server:
    ```
    $ cd server
    ```
3. Install dependencies: 
    ```
    $ npm i
    ```
4. Compilation command: 
    ```
    $ npx hardhat compile
    ```
5. Run command: 
    ```
    $ npx hardhat run ./script/deploy.js
    ```
6. Copy Paste the the contract Addresses in ./utils/RawMaterialJourney.js
7. Finally start the server
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```

#### Step 3: Run DAPP

1. Open a second terminal and navigate to the client folder:
    ```
    $ cd client
    ```
2. Install all packages in the `package.json` file:
    ```
    $ npm i
    ```

4. Run the development server:
    ```
    $ npm run dev
    ```

This setup guide should help streamline the process for developers looking to get started with the Supply-chain-dapp project.
